4. **Understand Full Stack Development**: Integrate front-end and back-end technologies to build full-fledged web applications.

5. **Learn Version Control**: Understand and utilize version control systems like Git and GitHub for efficient collaboration and code management.

6. **Develop Projects**: Create practical projects to apply and reinforce the acquired knowledge.
